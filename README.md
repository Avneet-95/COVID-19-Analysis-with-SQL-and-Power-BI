COVID-19 Analysis Using SQL and Power BI
Dataset Source: Our World in Data - COVID Deaths
Hello, data enthusiasts! ðŸŒŸ
I'm excited to share my latest portfolio project: COVID-19 Analysis Using SQL & Power BI.

Working with a vast dataset like this was an enriching experience. Transforming raw data into meaningful insights and interactive visualizations kept me motivated throughout this project.

ðŸŒŸ Report Overview
This analysis primarily focuses on Cases, Deaths, and Vaccinations, showcasing insights through two report pages: Global Stats and India's Stats.

Dataset Information:
The raw dataset is available at: COVID-19 Dataset
Data covers the period from 08-01-2020 to 21-08-2023, with over 330K+ rows.
ðŸ”¶ Page 1: Global Stats
KPIs: Displays total cases, deaths, and vaccinations globally.
Time-based Insights: Yearly, quarterly, and monthly slicers allow you to explore trends over time for cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
Top 8 Countries Analysis:
Column charts reveal the top 8 countries with the highest cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
Percentages of cases, deaths, and vaccinations relative to population are included (hover over tooltips for detailed information).
ðŸ”· Page 2: India's Stats
Dynamic KPIs: Displays total cases, deaths, and vaccinations for India.
Line Charts: Two distinct line charts highlight trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations, each serving a unique purpose.

ðŸ”¹ Workflow and Key Highlights
1. Data Preparation in Excel:
Removed unnecessary columns and created a refined dataset tailored for analysis.
2. SQL Queries in PostgreSQL:
Imported the dataset into PostgreSQL, adjusted data types, and used various SQL techniques:
SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, ALIAS, GROUP BY, HAVING, LIKE, SUM(), ROUND(),
Advanced features like CTE (Common Table Expressions), WINDOW FUNCTIONS, and VIEWS.
3. Visualization in Power BI:
Connected the PostgreSQL database to Power BI and visualized query results.
Built relationships between tables and created calculated columns and DAX measures.
Added interactive buttons:
Eraser Icon: Clears all filters.
Next Icon: Navigates to the next page.
